# Introduction

This Ruby-based DSL allows you to create complex Graphviz DOT diagrams programmatically. With this DSL, you can define nodes, edges, and nested clusters that represent relationships and hierarchies visually.

### Features

- Define nodes with attributes like labels, images, shapes, and sizes.
- Easily create connections (edges) between nodes.
- Define nested clusters to group nodes hierarchically.
- Generates a Graphviz `.dot` file, compatible with Graphviz tools for rendering diagrams.

### Example DOT File Generated

Here's a sample of the `.dot` file generated by this DSL
~~~
digraph G {
    rankdir=LR;
    pad=2.0;
    splines=ortho;
    nodesep=0.60;
    ranksep=0.75;
    subgraph cluster_targets {
        label="Targets";
        style=rounded;
        ...
    }
}
~~~
