# Diagrams in Ruby

This Ruby-based DSL allows you to create complex Graphviz DOT diagrams programmatically.

Graphviz provides the CLI for converting `.dot` files into images.

With this DSL, you can define nodes, edges, and nested clusters that represent relationships and hierarchies visually.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```Ruby
gem 'diagrams-rb', '~> 0.1'
```

or install:

```Ruby
gem install diagrams-rb
```

To use this DSL and render the `.dot` files it generates, you need to install [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org). See the [documentation](https://g-omahony.github.io/diagrams-rb-docs/docs/installation/) for more details.

## Usage

See the [documentation](https://g-omahony.github.io/diagrams-rb-docs/) for details and examples.
